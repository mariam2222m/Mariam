Project Description:This repository contains a simple Python tool that analyzes a set of text files and highlights each sentence using HTML tags. The more similar two sentences are, the more similar their highlight colors will be. The tool uses scikit-learn and numpy libraries to compute sentence similarity and generate highlighted HTML.
